- 👋 Hi, I’m @weradevelops or Weronika.

- 👀 I’m interested in creating responsive and interactive web experiences, exploring modern front-end frameworks like React, and honing my CSS skills to build visually stunning UI components.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced React patterns, state management libraries, and exploring TypeScript for type-safe development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that enhance user accessibility, front-end components, or design systems that contribute to the developer community.

- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach out to me via LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/weronikaszpejewska/ or send me an email at weronika.szpe@gmail.com.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I've lived in Poland, Ireland, and Canada, and I enjoy challenging myself with indoor rock climbing and learning piano.
